# Github Actions Analyzer
Brought to you by [Statsig](https://www.statsig.com) Open Source

A tool for analyzing github actions usage csv files.  Github allows admins to download billing and usage information, but doesn't do much to help you make sense of it.  This is meant to be a lightweight web tool to help you make sense of your github actions usage.

You can access the tool at [https://statsig-io.github.io/github-actions-analyzer/](https://statsig-io.github.io/github-actions-analyzer/).

To download a csv file from github to use with this tool, see the instructions here [https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/viewing-your-github-actions-usage).
